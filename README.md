# Lab 04 â€” Framework Challenge
I used https://sharpen.design to generate a random challenge.
The challenge was to "Design a feedback form for a school in France."
Hence the text being in French.

The site is currently deployed at https://delightful-crisp-727ec5.netlify.app.

The text, in order, says:
 * "Feedback form"
 * "First Name" "Last Name"
 * "Email"
 * "Rating"
 * "Describe your comments"
 * "Please share your experience with us today."
 * "Submit"

Text was translated from English using https://deepl.com.
